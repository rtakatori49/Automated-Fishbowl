# Automated Fishbowl

This was created in order to reduce the effort required to reserve a fishbowl.

The application will allow the user to input the information neccessary to reserve their respective fishbowl time slots. After the first time, the input will be stored in a text file called "user_info.txt", and no input will be necessary. Combined with Task Scheduler, the application can run automatically. The code is written in Python, with Tkinter for the GUI and Selenium to webscrape.
