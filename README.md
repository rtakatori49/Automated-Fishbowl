# Automated Fishbowl

This was created in order to reduce the effort required to reserve a fishbowl.

The application will allow the user to input the information neccessary to reserver their respective fishbowl time slots. Combined with Task Scheduler, the application can run automatically. The code is written in Python, with Tkinter for the GUI and Selenium to webscrape.
